These altered entitygroups files will have a reduced chance of spawning enZombies during the bloodmoon horde night. 

entitygroups_50.xml
entitygroups_25.xml
entitygroups_10.xml

Select the file above that matches the reduced percentage of enZombies you prefer for the horde night.

10% = 10 percent of the original enZombie amount will spawn during Bloodmoon
25% = 25 percent of the original enZombie amount will spawn during Bloodmoon
50% = 50 percent of the original enZombie amount will spawn during Bloodmoon

All other zombie groups (like wandering hordes, scout hordes, etc) and zombie behaviors are unchanged.
