ErrorNull Zombies (enZombies) v2.71
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/24594-enzombies-more-zombie-variations/


ErrorNull Zombies (enZombies): This mod has been updated for Alpha 20 and adds much more zombie variations to the game, using the UMA archetype method most notably showcased by the Snufkin's Custom Server Side Zombies - PLUS mod maintained by arramus. All the UMA Zombies by khzmusik are also included in enZombies. The goal of this mod is to always be server-side, thus only needs to be installed on the server, and not on the individual clients. These zombies are meant to be your average walkers and crawlers to complement the existing vanilla ones.. though stronger and boss-level zombies are slowly being added. Each enZombie also has their own feral and radiated variant. 

enZombies spawn out in the terrain based on the biome, with each zombie group sporting a unique color theme that matches the biome.  So you will find foresty zombies in the forest, deserty zombies in the desert, snowy zombies in the snow, and so forth. enZombies also spawn in many other scenarios, like in wandering hordes, screamer hordes, sleepers in POIs, and during the bloodmoon horde night. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to spawn zombies in these other scenarios while also based on specific biomes, so a more random range of enZombies will be seen there.  

The short challenge quests are an underutilized feature in the vanilla game, and enZombies appear within them as well. New challenge quests have also been added to showcase the new zombies. All new quests are simply found as items within the usual loot containers where vanilla quests are found. Many more quests are planned. 

- Goblin Raid
- Forest Goblin Raid
- Desert Goblin Raid
- Snow Goblin Raid
- Red Goblin Raid
- Wasteland Goblin Raid
- Business Meeting Gone Wrong


COMPATIBILITY: enZombies and the add-ons (see Add-ons section) are designed for Alpha 20. Using other mods with enZombie might work and might not. Even if an unsupported mod does work without errors, it will be missing the custom biome spawn behavior that enZombies use. If there is enough demand for a specific unsupported mod, I can create a patch mod for it (see Patches section) so that it works with enZombies and recognizes the custom biome spawn groups. If you are getting errors or strange glitches while using unsupported mods with enZombies, feel free to report the errors and what other mods you are using, and I'll be glad to take a glance when I get the chance. 


USAGE: You may use my mod as it is presented, or just pull my zombie definitions from archetypes.xml and entityclasses.xml and merge them into your own mod. Don't forget to grab corresponding code from items.xml and buff.xml. If you are just pulling the zombie XML code, I'd appreciate if you credit me somewhere like on your website, discord or forum post. The more exposure enZombies can have, the more players use it, and the more motivation for me to continue development. I love making these custom zombies and hope to continue on for a long while, but it does take lots of time and effort. 


ADD-ONS: These are optional mods created for enZombies. The main enZombies mod must be installed in order for these Add-Ons to work. 

*** enZombie Harvest Add-On **** This mod allows players to harvest all enZombies and vanilla zombies for resources (eg. cloth, rotten flesh, bones) when they are defeated. Zombies that carry bags or backpacks can also be looted before harvesting their corpses. To counter-balance the added abundance of resources from zombie harvesting, this mod also slightly increases the resource requirements of any recipes that rely on them. https://github.com/ErrorNull0/enZombieHarvest

*** enZombie Settings Add-On *** A collection of small mods that allow adjusting certain zombie settings: No Nudes, Attack Range, Wilderness Spawn Amount, Wandering Horde Spawn Amount, Removing Zombies, and Adjust HP. Download the add-on package and take the specific folder that matches the setting you wish to adjust and place it into your 7 Days to Die "Mods" folder. https://github.com/ErrorNull0/enZombieSettings


PATCHES: Install these 'patch' mods to make enZombies compatible with its 'target' mod. Go to the enZombiePatches GitHub page. These patch mods do two things: makes the target mod aware of the new custom spawning groups that enZombies uses for outside biome spawning. And, it allows the player to enable zombie body harvesting for the zombies or entities that are part of the target mod. Instructions: 1) Download the package which will include all the patch mods listed below. 2) Open the package and find the folder that matches the target mod you want compatibility for. 3) Take that folder and place it into your 7 Days to Die "Mods" folder. 4) Be sure to have the main enZombies mod installed. 5) Be sure you also install the main target mod that the patch is patching. https://github.com/ErrorNull0/enZombiePatches

KNOWN ISSUES: There are some interesting bugs when working with UMA zombies and molding them from the archetypes.xml. It's not unique to enZombies and are present in any mod that uses UMA style zombies - for example, the Snufkin mod also contain some UMA zombies which will experience these bugs. In my opinion, the relative ease in creating and modifying these zombies outweigh the quirks: 

- UMA zombies fly amazing distances when struck with a powerful attack. Their physics seem to be more 'floaty' compared to the vanilla zombies. This also results in the occasional zombie getting stuck into nearby walls and bars when explosions and powerful attacks send them rag-dolling overhead. To some this is a bug, to others this is a feature.

- UMA zombies do not collide with player vehicles whether driven or parked. So the zombies will simply walk right through them. This behavior does not occur with the abandoned POI vehicles that litter the landscape - UMA zombies interact with them like normal. When zombie vehicle collision was added to the vanilla zombies, the devs did not add that feature to the UMA system. 

- UMA zombies don't get shocked when walking into electric fence traps.. not really, at least. It seems that if they are knocked down while on the fence, they will occasionally get shocked! Stun batons behave normally and shock the zombies just fine. 

- UMA zombies do not show the crawling animations when they crawl through the 1 bock spaces. The ability for zombies to crawl through 1 block spaces is fairly recent, but the devs did not implement that update for the UMA system. 

- UMA zombies appear to cause a 'micro-freeze' or stutter in the game each time a set number of them are spawned. This was not the case (or it was very insignificant) in Alpha 19. The number of zombies that trigger this stutter seem to range from 5 to 8. Thus, while exploring POIs and encountering sleeper zombies, or fighting through horde night, there will be a short stutter when every 5th to 8th UMA zombie is spawned in. The severity of the micro-freeze might depend on your system specs, but it's not completely certain at this point.
 
- There is a NullReferenceException error that can occur when sleepers are spawning inside POIs. Majority of the incidents are occurring during trader quest, and can sometimes even result in a sleeper zombie being spawned invisible - which can be a vanilla zombie and possibly UMA zombie. Unfortunately, this zombie cannot be killed and if part of a Clear quest will cause the quest to fail. This issue is still being investigated. Troubleshooting is challenging as this NRE error appears intermittent and not tied to a specific POI or specific UMA zombie. However, it only occurs when UMA zombies are spawning as sleepers. If you encounter this NRE error - please take a screenshot (or send me the log) and let me know which POI and if the error was repeatable later at the same POI. This will help with the research. 

Let me know if it helps or even if it does not help.. that information will be useful for further research. Thanks!
